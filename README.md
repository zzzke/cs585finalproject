To run the program, make sure you have configured the following environment on your computer:

1. Install Xcode (v8.0 or above) on your Macbook.
(Install Visual Studio is theoretically feasible, but may encounter other problems.)

2. Configure OpenCV environment on your laptop (our version is v3.1.0).

3. Plug in two usb cameras.

3. Open "Writing_Recog_System.xcodeproj" in Xcode.

4. You may configure "VideoCapture" parameter in main.cpp file (line 38-39)to enable our program to identify your cameras.

5. Place two cameras at the right position. One on top of your hand with appropriate distance and other on the left edge of your desk.

5. Run the project in Xcode and enjoy the innovated writing experience.
